# 🔁 Customer Churn Prediction (ML Project)
Machine learning project predicting customer churn using Decision Tree. Includes Excel files, PDF report, and Python implementation.

This project applies supervised machine learning to predict customer churn using a real-world dataset. Developed in RapidMiner and re-implemented in Python, it includes Excel preprocessing, decision tree modeling, and business insights.

## 🧠 Highlights
- Built using Excel, RapidMiner, and Python
- Applied Decision Tree classification
- Accuracy: 87.4%
- Key predictors: Age, LastTransaction, Payment Method
- Model tested with cross-validation and ROC

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Excel
- RapidMiner
- Python (scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
